Initial commit: A beginning after countless struggles

Dear Future Me,

If you’re reading this, it means you’ve come a long way since the early days of this project. This initial commit represents more than just the start of code—it symbolizes the countless hours of frustration, the sleepless nights, and the moments when giving up seemed like the only option.

I remember how overwhelming it was, feeling like I could barely get anything right. Each small progress felt monumental, each setback devastating. But through it all, the hard work, the persistence, and the hope that something good would come from it never waned.

This commit is a tribute to all those times you felt defeated but kept going. It’s a testament to every struggle that made this project what it is today. When you look back at this, remember the journey, the pain, and the triumphs. Reflect on how far you've come from those early days of doubt.

I hope you can see now that the effort was worth it. The result might not be perfect, but it’s a culmination of your determination and resilience. 

Keep pushing forward, and remember: every challenge faced was a step towards something greater.

With all the struggles and hope,

- Your Past Self
